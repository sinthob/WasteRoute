# WasteRoute

Angular frontend generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) 19.2.15.

## Development server

To start a local dev server:

```bash
ng serve
```

Open http://localhost:4200/ after the server starts. The app reloads automatically on file changes.

## Code scaffolding

Generate a new component:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

See all schematics:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Build

```bash
ng build
```

Artifacts are output to `dist/`. Production builds are optimized by default.

## Unit tests

```bash
ng test
```

## End-to-end tests

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI doesn’t ship an e2e framework by default; choose and set up one as needed.
